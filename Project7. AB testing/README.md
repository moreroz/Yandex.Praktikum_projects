# Initial data
- AB testing results for online store
- List of hypotheses prioritised using ICE and RICE frameworks
# Goals
Launch an A/B test and analyze the results.
# Libraries used
- pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- seaborn
- numpy
- datetime
- scipy
# Content
The following tasks were solved:
- Hypotheses about store development were analyzed (ICE and RICE frameworks)
- AB test results were analyzed
# Main conclusions
- Further steps for the online store development were identified 
- It was decided to stop the test and to consider group B as a leader. Although average order didn't increase, it's not lower than in group A. At the same time conversion in group B is consistently higher.
